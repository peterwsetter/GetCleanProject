### Codebook for avgMeanStd and meanStdData
This codebook is based off of features_info.txt and the README from the UCI HAR Dataset. See that document for a full description of their features and measurement.

All values are unitless as the researchers normalized and bounded the values to [-1,1].
The following abbreviations were used in creating the feature names.
* t: time domain
* f: Fast Fourier Transform was applied to data
* BodyAcc: Body linear acceleration
* Gravity: Gravity acceleration
* Gyro: Gyroscope measurement
* Jerk: Change in acceleration
* Mag: Magnitude of Eucliean norm of the axial signals
* X, Y, Z: Measurement in corresponding axial direction
* Std: Standard Deviation
